# UFOs

## Project Overview 

The purpose of this project was to provide an interactive web-based portal to allow users to search through a database of UFO sightings. Users can filter the database by sighting date, city, state, country, and shape of the object. Results are updated in real time as users enter search terms in each respective filter box. 

## Results 

As will be demonstrated through the screen captures below, our interactive portal has made it very easy to search though the UFO database. As we can see in figure 1, when a user first arrives on our site, they are presented with a brief description of the page and its purpose, our 5 filters below this on the left, and all of the reports unfiltered to the right of these. 

### Figure 1.

A user can then enter specific search criteria for each filter in order to drill down the type of sightings they are looking for. In figure 2 we have filtered our results by country to the US only. As we can see, all the sighting entries displayed to the right are only those originating in the US.

If the user wishes to add more filters, the can continue to do so. In figure 3 we have added a filter of triangle in the "enter a shape" filter box, in addition to the country filter "US". The results to the right show only sightings that occurred in the US, and have a reported shape of triangle.

Finally, if the user wishes to reset the filters, they can either delete all entries in each filter box, or simply click "UFO Sightings" in the upper left corner of the page, circled in red in Figure 4.

## Summary 

Overall, this is a pretty responsive portal given the relatively limited amount of work that was required to get it functioning. However, there is certainly room for improvement. Probably the most glaring drawback to our search functions is the necessity that our search terms exactly match those found in the database. So for instance, if someone entered "US" in the country filter box, nothing would come up as all entries in the database use lower case "us". One improvement would be using a case-insensitive match for each filter box. In addition, it would be great to include a "comments keywords" filter that would search the comments for any keyword a user might wish to enter.
